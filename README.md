# SABER-GeoJSON-ArcGIS_Script
ArcGIS Toolbox tool to pull SABER GeoJSON into ArcGIS

We have put together a script and an arc gis toolbox tool that will pull down the geojson data (really just 2 fields are pulled, Categories and Status) , creates a feature class and then if you want, will update and print a map to pdf. The zip file attached has all of it packaged up. The saber.gdb needs to stay where itâ€™s at in order for the process to work. Otherwise you can just open up the tool in arc catalog and run it, or just execute the script and it will update the feature class in the gdb for you. 

To open the zip file, change the file extension from .zzz to .zip and unzip it where you want it.
